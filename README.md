# Calligraphy
This repository contains experiments with the [Calliar Arabic Calligraphy SVG Dataset](https://github.com/ARBML/Calliar).

## concat
An experimentally hacked clone of the original Calliar repository, made more portable with reframing as a poetry project with dependency management.  Use `translate.py` to programmatically append english translations to arabic filenames via Google Translate API.
